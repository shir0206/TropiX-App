##  :pineapple: About
TropiX is an Android Game designed for children in Israel.</br>
At the beginning of the game, the user receives a list of characters, known as TropiX, from which he can choose a character representing his player and a character representing the opponent's player.</br>
Then the user can choose the game board he wants to play. The user can choose whether he wants to play against another player (offline) or against the computer.</br>
During the game, the user chooses which position on the board to put his character and so does the opponent. The winner is the character that is in sequence in a row / column / diagonal along the board. When the user wins, he wins coins.</br>
He can enter the TropiX-shop, and through the coins he has accumulated, he can purchase additional characters for the next games. (The score and characters purchased are permanently saved on the device).</br>
